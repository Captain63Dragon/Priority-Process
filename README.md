# Priority-Process
The project is based on a tutorial on how to use JavaScript and the DOM without JQuery or other frameworks.
It will be extended to flesh out a web based Priority exploration application<br />
It is an experiment and a test bed but is a stand-alone app and has some interesting functionality.<br />

Technologies used: Javascript, JQuery, Materialize, font-awesome and JSON<br />
General Directions: Start on the  taskList.html page or the questionList.html page. <br />
Add tasks you would like to prioritize and a clarification question that helps to decide <br />
which task is more important. From the Question List page, add a question. You are immediately <br />
taken to the Priority page. Select the tasks you want for your question. There will eventually <br />
hide function to remove tasks that are unrelated to the current question. When you are satisfied <br />
with the list of tasks, go to the Prioritize page. The question of the Day page shows the question <br />
and two of the selected task. Pick one and move to the next pair untill all the tasks have been <br />
ranked. Now return to the Priority page by selecting Done.<br /><br />
